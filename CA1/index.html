        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p> <strong>java</strong> is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to
            have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended
            to let
            programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),<sup>[17]</sup>meaning that compiled Java code can run on all
            platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.<sup>[18]</sup> Java applications are typically
            compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer
            architecture. The syntax of
            Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime
            provides dynamic
            capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in
            traditional
            compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to
            GitHub,<sup>[19][20]</sup> particularly for client–server web applications, with a reported 9 million
            developers.<sup>[21]</sup></p>

        <p>Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in May 1995 as a core
            component
            of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual
            machines,
            and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in
            compliance
            with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies
            under
            the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference
            implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the
            default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.

        <p> As of March 2022, Java 18 is the latest version, while Java 17, 11 and 8 are the current long-term support
            (LTS)
            versions. Oracle released the last zero-cost public update for the legacy version Java 8 LTS in January 2019
            for
            commercial use, although it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates for personal use
            indefinitely. Other vendors have begun to offer zero-cost builds of OpenJDK 8 and 11 that are still
            receiving
            security and other upgrades.</p>

        <p> Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling outdated and unsupported versions of Java, due to
            unresolved
            security issues in older versions<sup>[22]</sup>. Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to a
            supported version, such as one of the LTS versions (8, 11, 17).</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June
                1991.<sup>[23]</sup> Java was
                originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television
                industry at the time<sup>[24]</sup>. The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood
                outside Gosling's
                office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, a type
                of coffee from
                Indonesia.<sup>[25]</sup> Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application
                programmers would find
                familiar<sup>[26]</sup>.
            </p>

            <p>Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996.[27] It promised write
                once, run
                anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and
                featuring
                configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers soon
                incorporated
                the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular. The Java 1.0 compiler
                was
                re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language
                specification.<sup>[28]</sup> With the
                advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 – 1999), new versions had multiple
                configurations built for
                different types of platforms. J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically
                run in
                server environments, while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was
                renamed
                J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE,
                respectively.</p>
            <p> In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later the Ecma International
                to
                formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process.<sup>[29][30][31]</sup> Java remains a de facto
                standard, controlled
                through the Java Community Process.<sup>[32]</sup> At one time, Sun made most of its Java
                implementations available without
                charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling
                of licenses for
                specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.

                <br>November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine (JVM) as free and open-source
                software
                (FOSS), under the terms of the GPL-2.0-only license. <br>On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process,
                making all of its
                JVM's core code available under free software/open-source distribution terms, aside from a small portion
                of code to which
                Sun did not hold the copyright.<sup>[33]</sup> Sun's vice-president Rich Green said that Sun's ideal
                role with regard to Java was as an
                evangelist.<sup>[34]</sup>
                Following Oracle Corporation's acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2009–10, Oracle has described itself
                as the steward of
                Java technology with a relentless commitment to fostering a community of participation and
                transparency.<sup>[35]</sup> This did
                not prevent Oracle from filing a lawsuit against Google shortly after that for using Java inside the
                Android SDK
                (see the Android section).

                <br>On April 2, 2010, James Gosling resigned from Oracle.<sup>[36]</sup>

                <br>In January 2016, Oracle announced that Java run-time environments based on JDK 9 will discontinue
                the
                browser
                plugin.<sup>[37]</sup>

                Java software runs on everything from laptops to data centers, game consoles to scientific
                supercomputers.<sup>[38]</sup>
            </p>

                <h2>Principles</h2>
                <p>There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:<sup>[18]</sup>

                    <br> 1. It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.
                    <br> 2. It must be robust and secure.
                    <br> 3. It must be architecture-neutral and portable.
                    <br> 4. It must execute with high performance.
                    <br> 5. It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.
                </p>
            
                <h2>Versions</h2>
                <p>
                    As of September 2021, Java 8, 11 and 17 are supported as Long-Term Support (LTS)
                    versions.<sup>[39]</sup>
